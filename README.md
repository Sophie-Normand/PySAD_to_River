The objective of this project is to adapt anomaly detection models from PySAD package to the River framework in online learning.
After testing 3 algorithms (LODA, RS-Hash and xStream), we succeed to adapt the xStream algorithm, and did a pull request to maybe implement in the future this algorithm.
